<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Social Snipe?</h3>

<p>Social Snipe is (or will be) a PHP/MySQL open source solution for social media teams to manage scheduled posts and workflow. Or at least it will be. Right now it's in the planning phase where we're figuring out core features.</p>

<h3><a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Speaking of Core Features... </h3>

<p>Buzzword bingo aside, the plan is simple. This project is meant to allow a social media team of any size to throw content into a queue, optionally have an Editor role team member approve it and schedule it, and then it gets posted according to schedule. </p>

<p>So far, what we consider to be core features are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>User management with role/ACL support</strong> (Contributor, Editor, Read-Only Reviewer to start)</li>
	<li><strong>Bookmarklet/email address monitoring</strong> to allow team members to easily add items to the queue for team review</li>
	<li><strong>Post scheduling</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Export/Print view/automated review email</strong> to send to managers and c-levels for overview of content schedule</li>
	<li><strong>Basic post analytics</strong> - retweets, shares, likes, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scope</h3>
<p>Currently, the scope as we see it is as listed above, although the scope will hopefully evolve over time. </p>

<p><strong>What Social Snipe isn't:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A replacement for a fully-feautured social analytics/sentiment analysis tool.</li>
	<li>A tool for replying to social media interactions. (This may change, but it's not currently a priority for me.)</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Open Source?</h3>
<p>Because frankly, all of the available tools are either lacking in basic collaboration features, or are way out budget for small businesses or small teams who just want to bring some sanity into the process of working together as a team to find and publish great content.  </p>

<h3><a name="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Want to help?</h3>
<p>Awesome! Once we've got some code up here, feel free to submit pull requests. Hit me up on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/snipeyhead">@snipeyhead</a> with questions.  </p>

<p>If you're not a dev but still have great ideas, use-cases, etc, let me know!</p>
